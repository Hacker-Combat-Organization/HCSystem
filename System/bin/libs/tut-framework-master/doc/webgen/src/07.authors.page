Template Unit Test framework was designed and written by Vladimir Dyuzhev,
who currently lives in Toronto, Canada. His personal site is

In recent years TUT was part-time maintained by Denis Kononenko.

Since 2008 it's maintained and developed by [Micha≈Ç Rzechonek](http://rzechonek.net).

We would like to thank all contributors, especially Nokia Siemens Networks IPT CS team for extensive
real world testing.
